/**
 * Describes a type that is inhabited by a finite set of values.
 *
 * Every finite type is isomorphic to some initial segment `[0, .. , n)` of ℕ,
 * the set of natural numbers, although the bijection is of course not unique,
 * there being one for each of the `n!` permutations of the `n` values.
 *
 * Any such mapping is sufficient to uniquely encode the values of the type as
 * natural numbers, however, allowing us to easily enumerate them,  store them
 * in bit sets, and so forth.
 *
 * Instances satisfy the axioms:
 * {{{
 *           size  >  0                                  α is inhabited
 *         toℕ(a)  ∈  [0, size)                          to initial segment
 *    fromℕ ∘ toℕ  =  identity[α]                        toℕ   is injective
 *    toℕ ∘ fromℕ  =  identity[ℕ]                        fromℕ is injective
 * }}}
 * for all `a` in `α`, where `∘` denotes function composition.
 *
 * @tparam α  A type inhabited by a finite set of values.
